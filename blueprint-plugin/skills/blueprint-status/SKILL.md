Display the current blueprint configuration status with three-layer architecture breakdown.

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--report-only` | Display status report and exit without prompting for next action |

**Steps**:

1. **Check if blueprint is initialized**:
   - Look for `docs/blueprint/manifest.json`
   - If not found, report:
     ```
     Blueprint not initialized in this project.
     Run `/blueprint:init` to get started.
     ```

2. **Read manifest and gather information**:
   - Parse `manifest.json` for version and configuration
   - Parse `id_registry` for traceability metrics
   - Count PRDs in `docs/prds/`
   - Count ADRs in `docs/adrs/`
   - Count PRPs in `docs/prps/`
   - For ADRs, also count:
     - With domain tags (`grep -l "^domain:" docs/adrs/*.md | wc -l`)
     - With relationship declarations (supersedes, extends, related)
     - By status (Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated)
   - Count work-orders (pending, completed, archived)
   - Count generated rules in `.claude/rules/`
   - Count custom skills in `.claude/skills/`
   - Count custom commands in `.claude/commands/`
   - Check for `.claude/rules/` directory
   - Check for `CLAUDE.md` file
   - Check for `docs/blueprint/feature-tracker.json`
   - If feature tracker exists, read statistics and last_updated
   - Read `task_registry` from manifest (if present)
   - For each task, calculate schedule status:
     - `ok`: Not yet due based on schedule
     - `due`: Due for execution based on schedule
     - `overdue`: Past due by more than 1 schedule period (e.g., daily task not run in 2+ days)
     - `disabled`: `enabled: false`
     - `never`: `last_completed_at` is null (never tracked)

3. **Check for upgrade availability**:
   - Compare `format_version` in manifest with current plugin version
   - Current format version: **3.0.0**
   - If manifest version < current → upgrade available

4. **Check generated content status**:
   - For each generated rule in manifest:
     - Hash current file content
     - Compare with stored `content_hash`
     - Status: `current` (unchanged), `modified` (user edited), `stale` (source PRDs changed)

5. **Display status report**:
   ```

   {If upgrade available:}
   Upgrade available: v{current} → v{latest}
      Run `/blueprint:upgrade` to upgrade.

   {If modified generated content:}
   Modified content detected: {count} files
      Run `/blueprint:sync` to review changes.
      Run `/blueprint:promote [name]` to move to custom layer.

   {If stale generated content:}
   Stale content detected: {count} files (PRDs changed since generation)
      Run `/blueprint:generate-skills` to regenerate.

   {If up to date:}
   Blueprint is up to date.
   ```

6. **Additional checks**:
   - Warn if any tasks are overdue (e.g., "3 maintenance tasks overdue - run `/blueprint:execute` to catch up")
   - Warn if feature-tracker.json is stale (> 1 day since last update)
   - Warn if PRDs exist but no generated rules
   - Warn if modular rules enabled but `.claude/rules/` is empty
   - Warn if generated content is modified or stale
   - Warn if feature-tracker.json is older than 7 days (needs sync)
   - Warn if TODO.md has been modified since last sync
   - Warn if ADRs have potential issues:
     - Multiple "Accepted" ADRs in same domain (potential conflict)
     - ADRs without domain tags (harder to detect conflicts)
     - Missing bidirectional links (e.g., supersedes without corresponding superseded_by)
   - **Traceability checks**:
     - Warn if documents exist without IDs (run `/blueprint:sync-ids`)
     - Warn if orphan documents exist (docs without GitHub issues)
     - Warn if orphan issues exist (GitHub issues without linked docs)
     - Warn if broken links detected (referenced docs/issues don't exist)

7. **If `--report-only`**: Output the status report from Steps 5-6 and exit. Skip the interactive prompt below.

8. **Prompt for next action** (use AskUserQuestion):

   **Build options dynamically based on state:**
   - If upgrade available → Include "Upgrade to v{latest}"
   - If modified content → Include "Sync generated content"
   - If stale content → Include "Regenerate skills"
   - If PRDs exist but no generated skills → Include "Generate skills from PRDs"
   - If skills exist but no commands → Include "Generate workflow commands"
   - If CLAUDE.md stale → Include "Update CLAUDE.md"
   - If feature tracker exists but stale → Include "Sync feature tracker"
   - If ADRs have potential issues → Include "Validate ADRs"
   - If documents without IDs → Include "Sync document IDs"
   - If orphan documents/issues → Include "Link documents to GitHub"
   - If overdue tasks exist → Include "Run overdue maintenance tasks"
   - Always include "Continue development" and "I'm done"

   ```
   question: "What would you like to do?"
   options:
     # Dynamic - include based on state detected above
     - label: "Upgrade to v{latest}" (if upgrade available)
       description: "Upgrade blueprint format to latest version"
     - label: "Sync generated content" (if modified)

     # Always include these:
     - label: "Continue development"
       description: "Run /project:continue to work on next task"
     - label: "I'm done for now"
       description: "Exit status check"
   ```

   **Based on selection:**
   - "Upgrade" → Run `/blueprint:upgrade`
   - "Sync" → Run `/blueprint:sync`
   - "Regenerate" → Run `/blueprint:generate-rules`
   - "Generate rules" → Run `/blueprint:generate-rules`

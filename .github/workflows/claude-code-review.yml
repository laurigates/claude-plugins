            Review this pull request. Focus on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or security issues
            - Test coverage gaps
            - Documentation needs

            IMPORTANT: Use built-in tools (Read, Grep, Glob) for file exploration.
            Do NOT use Bash for find/grep operations - use the dedicated tools instead.

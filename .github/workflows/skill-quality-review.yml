            Review the changed skill and command files in this PR for quality compliance.
            Read the rules at .claude/rules/skill-quality.md for the full checklist.

            Changed files:
            ${{ steps.changed.outputs.files }}

            For each changed SKILL.md or command file, check:

            1. **Size**: Is SKILL.md under 500 lines? If over, suggest extracting to REFERENCE.md.
            2. **"When to Use" table**: Does it have a decision table helping Claude choose this skill?
            3. **Agentic Optimizations**: Does it have a compact commands table? (required for CLI/tool skills)
            4. **Description quality**: Does the description match user intents, not just tool jargon?
            5. **Model selection**: Is `haiku` used for CLI tools and `opus` only for complex reasoning?
            6. **Supporting file links**: If REFERENCE.md exists, is it linked with `[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)`?
            7. **Frontmatter**: Are name, description, allowed-tools, and date fields present?

            For each issue found, leave a specific, actionable review comment on the relevant file.
            If all checks pass, leave a brief approval comment.

            Do NOT suggest changes unrelated to skill quality (no code style, no typo fixes).
            Focus ONLY on the quality checklist above.

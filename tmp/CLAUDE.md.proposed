# CLAUDE.md

Personal configuration for Claude Code. Specific skills and workflows are provided by plugins.

## Directory Management

This `.claude` directory is managed via chezmoi's `exact_dot_claude/` with the `exact_` prefix.

**Why exact_ instead of symlink:**
- Process stability: Symlinks caused race conditions during modifications
- Atomic updates: `chezmoi apply` provides explicit checkpoints
- Auto-cleanup: Orphaned files are automatically removed
- Predictable state: Target always matches source after apply

**Runtime directories preserved** (via `.chezmoiignore`):
- `plans/`, `projects/`, `session-env/`, `shell-snapshots/`, `settings.local.json`

**Workflow:**
```bash
chezmoi apply -v ~/.claude  # After editing skills/commands/config
```

## Communication Style

- Lead with the specific answer or relevant observations
- Direct, academic style—integrate acknowledgment into substantive discussion
- Avoid standalone agreement openers ("You're absolutely right")
- Frame instructions positively (what to do, not what to avoid)

## Core Principles

**Delegation-first**: Prefer subagents for multi-step tasks, code exploration, reviews, debugging, and domain-specific work. Handle directly only for trivial single-file edits. See `agent-patterns-plugin` for detailed delegation patterns.

**Documentation-first**: Research relevant documentation (context7, web search) before implementation. Verify against official docs.

**Test-driven**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR. Write tests before implementation.

**Simplicity**: Prioritize readability over cleverness. Convention over configuration. Don't over-engineer.

**Fail fast**: Let failures surface immediately. Avoid error swallowing that masks problems.

**Boy Scout Rule**: Leave code cleaner than you found it.

## Tool Preferences

Use specialized skills from plugins rather than ad-hoc commands. Key plugins:

| Need | Plugin |
|------|--------|
| File finding, code search | `tools-plugin` (fd, rg, ast-grep) |
| Git & GitHub workflows | `git-plugin` |
| Testing strategies | `testing-plugin` |
| Agent orchestration | `agent-patterns-plugin` |
| PRD/ADR workflow | `blueprint-plugin` |
| Task runners | `tools-plugin` (justfile-expert) |

## Parallel Work

When tasks decompose into independent subtasks, launch multiple subagents simultaneously. Consolidate results after parallel execution completes.

## Development Notes

- Use `tmp/` in project root for temporary outputs (ensure it's in `.git/info/exclude`)
- Stay in repository root; specify paths as arguments rather than changing directories
- Commit early and often with conventional commits
- Run security checks before staging files

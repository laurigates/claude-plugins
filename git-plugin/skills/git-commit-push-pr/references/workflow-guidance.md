# Workflow Guidance

Moved verbatim from `SKILL.md`. Read when handling pre-commit output, choosing direct vs feature-branch mode, or writing issue references.

## Workflow Guidance

- After running pre-commit hooks, stage files modified by hooks using `git add -u`
- Unstaged changes after pre-commit are expected formatter output - stage them and continue
- **Direct mode** (`--direct`): Use `git push origin HEAD` to push current branch directly
- **Feature branch mode** (default): Create a local feature branch from main, commit there, push with `git push -u origin <branch>`
- When encountering unexpected state, report findings and ask user how to proceed
- Include all pre-commit automatic fixes in commits
- **GitHub issue references (REQUIRED)**: Every commit should reference related issues:
  - **Closing keywords** (`Fixes`, `Closes`, `Resolves`) auto-close issues when merged to default branch
  - **Reference keywords** (`Refs`, `Related to`, `See`) link without closing - use for partial work
  - Format examples: `Fixes #123`, `Fixes: #123`, `fixes org/repo#123`
  - Multiple issues: `Fixes #1, fixes #2, fixes #3` (repeat keyword for each)
  - When `--issue <num>` provided, use `Fixes #<num>` or `Closes #<num>` in commit body
  - If no specific issue exists, consider creating one first for traceability

# .gitattributes Conventions

A repo's `.gitattributes` is a path→attribute map git consults for **merge**,
**diff**, **checkout**, and **archive** behavior. This repo uses it for three
things; the reusable cross-repo automation is
[`configure-plugin:configure-gitattributes`](../../configure-plugin/skills/configure-gitattributes/SKILL.md),
and the conflict-resolution side is `.claude/rules/regression-testing.md` plus
`scripts/resolve-additive-conflicts.py`.

## The three uses (and what each is safe for)

| Attribute | Effect | Safe for | Never for |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| `merge=union` | Built-in driver; concatenates both sides' additions, no markers | **Append-only files where every logical entry is exactly one line** (the regression-testing table) | Code, JSON, multi-line-entry files, anything that gets *edited* not just appended |
| `text=auto eol=lf` | Normalize line endings to LF on commit/checkout | Any repo with shell scripts/hooks (CRLF silently breaks a shebang) | — (safe globally; no-op on an all-LF tree) |
| `linguist-generated` | Collapse in GitHub PR diffs + drop from language stats | Build output, tool-owned files (changelogs, lockfiles, rendered diagrams, compiled prompts) | — (display-only; changes **no** merge behavior, so safe even where `merge=union` is wrong) |

## `merge=union` — the one-line-per-entry test

Union merge is correct **only** when both sides add disjoint lines and every
entry is self-contained on one line. Apply the test before marking a file:

- ✅ `.claude/rules/regression-testing.md` — one table row per bug, append-only.
- ❌ `**/CHANGELOG.md` — entries are **multi-line**; union interleaves them
  wrongly. (Also release-please-owned — feature branches never append, so they
  don't conflict anyway.)
- ❌ `marketplace.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json` — JSON; union breaks syntax.
- ❌ Generated/compiled files — a conflict there is resolved by **regenerating**, not interleaving.

For one-line append tables not marked `merge=union`,
`scripts/resolve-additive-conflicts.py` (the deterministic pre-pass in
`auto-resolve-conflicts.yml`) still union-merges them generically — so the
`.gitattributes` allowlist is an optimization (clears the conflict in local
and CI merges), not the only safety net.

## GitHub does not honor `merge=union` server-side

**Empirically confirmed (PR #1759, 2026-06):** GitHub's mergeability check and
the **merge button** do NOT apply `.gitattributes merge=union`. A PR whose only
conflict is a union-marked file will still show `CONFLICTING` / `mergeStateStatus
DIRTY`, even though every *real* git merge (local, rebase, the
`auto-resolve-conflicts.yml` workflow) resolves it cleanly with zero markers.
The driver works everywhere git actually runs the merge — just not in GitHub's
server-side computation.

Fix to make such a PR mergeable: bring the base into the branch **locally**,
where the driver is active, so the base becomes an ancestor and GitHub has
nothing left to merge:

```sh
git fetch origin
git merge --no-ff origin/main      # union driver resolves the marked file here
git push                            # PR flips to MERGEABLE
```

(`--no-ff` because a divergent merge can't fast-forward, and a global
`merge.ff=only` would otherwise abort it.) This also doubles as a live proof the
driver works — the marked file gains both sides' rows with no hand-editing.

## `linguist-generated` is the safe default for generated trees

Because it only affects GitHub's display, marking a generated file
`linguist-generated` can never break a merge. Reach for it freely on build
output: compiled prompt trees (`*/generated/**`), rendered diagrams
(`docs/diagrams/*.svg` from committed `.d2` sources), release-please
changelogs/manifests, and lockfiles (`uv.lock`, `bun.lock`).

## Other affordances (lower priority)

`merge=ours` / `-merge` (refuse auto-merge), `linguist-vendored` /
`linguist-language=X` (language-stat / detection overrides), `diff=markdown` /
`diff=python` (better hunk headers), `-diff`/`binary` (treat as binary),
`export-ignore` (exclude from `git archive`). Reach for these only when a
concrete need appears — the three above cover the common cases.

## Authoring checklist

- [ ] `* text=auto eol=lf` (+ explicit `*.sh text eol=lf`) when the repo has shell scripts
- [ ] `merge=union` **only** on one-line-per-entry append-only files (run the test above)
- [ ] `linguist-generated` on build output / tool-owned files (always safe)
- [ ] Comment each non-obvious line with *why* it qualifies
- [ ] Verify a union mark with a sandbox merge (`git merge --no-ff` of two divergent appends → 0 markers, both entries)
